# CITS3002 Project

Written by: Athhar Djajasantosa (22676919)

The CITS3002 Project of 2022 consists of two parts: Rake-C and Rake-P.
Rake-C is to be written in C language while Rake-P is written in Python.

The files in this repository hold the first-half of the project: Rake-C.

Rake-C acts as a "makefile" for the usual C files. The only difference is that it allows for remote "making" of the files, hence "Rake-C".

Students had to create a "rakeserver" to go along with the other two Rake files but unfortunately, we could not make it in time.
